# Task Review Report: 1_task

## 1. Task Definition Validation
- Scope: Define Member aggregate, VOs, and domain events; enforce invariants; emit events on state transitions.
- PRD alignment: Captures civil/ecclesiastical fields (R1.1), classification on creation (R1.3), and lifecycle visibility (R5.2).
- Tech Spec alignment: Aggregate emits MemberRegistered/Updated/Archived/Restored/Deleted/ClassificationChanged; snapshot/rehydrate present.
- Acceptance criteria: Creation rejects invalid communicant inputs; transitions are idempotent; events emitted on change.

Validation checklist
- [x] Task requirements fully understood
- [x] PRD business objectives aligned
- [x] Technical specifications met (with noted improvements)
- [x] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Success metrics clear (not specified in task)

## 2. Rules Analysis Findings
### Applicable Rules
- code-standards: `ipt-web/rules/code-standards.md`
- layers.rules: `ipt-web/rules/layers.rules.md`
- architecture.rules: `ipt-web/rules/architecture.rules.md`
- testing approach (from Tech Spec): domain/application unit tests next to code (`*.spec.ts`)

### Compliance Status
- Naming/casing and file conventions followed; class and methods within size limits.
- Domain layer has no infra concerns; uses domain events; good encapsulation.
- Error handling uses generic `Error` instead of typed DomainException/InvalidOperationException.
- Controlled vocabularies (sex, maritalStatus, reception.mode) are `string`; PRD suggests controlled lists.
- Member domain tests missing.

## 3. Multi-Model Code Review Results

### Gemini-2.5-Pro Review
Complete feedback from Zen MCP:

"Excellent, I have analyzed the provided code and the investigation summary. The `Member` aggregate is a critical piece of your domain, and ensuring its correctness and maintainability is paramount. Here is my detailed review.

### Code Review

ðŸŸ  HIGH File:`/Users/brunozamorano/iptijuquinhas/ipt-web/src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts`:Line 166 â€“ Inconsistent and overly generic error handling
The entity throws generic `Error` objects. While it uses error codes, this approach lacks type safety and makes it difficult for upstream callers (like application services or controllers) to programmatically handle specific domain validation failures. The project standard appears to favor a `DomainException`, which should be used for consistency.

â†’ Fix: Replace `new Error(...)` with a more specific, typed exception like `DomainException` or `InvalidOperationException`. This allows for better error handling and adheres to a consistent error strategy across the domain layer.

```typescript
// src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts

// At line 166
context_start_text: const missing = required.filter(([_, v]) => v === undefined || v === null || (typeof v === 'string' && v.trim().length === 0));
if (missing.length > 0) throw new DomainException(MemberErrorCodes.MISSING_COMMUNICANT_REQUIRED_FIELDS);
context_end_text: }

// At line 209
context_start_text: const sanitized = Member.sanitizeFullName(name);
if (!Member.isValidFullName(sanitized)) throw new DomainException(MemberErrorCodes.INVALID_FULL_NAME);
context_end_text: return sanitized;

// At line 215
context_start_text: if (c === 'communicant' || c === 'non-communicant') return c;
throw new DomainException(MemberErrorCodes.INVALID_CLASSIFICATION);
context_end_text: }
```

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM File:`/Users/brunozamorano/iptijuquinhas/ipt-web/src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts`:Line 80 â€“ Misleading property in `MemberUpdateProps`
The `MemberUpdateProps` interface includes an optional `classification` property, but the `update` method (lines 218-244) intentionally ignores it. The comment `// Prefer changeClassification()` is a code smell indicating a confusing API. This can lead developers to believe they can change the classification via `update`, which would bypass the specific `MemberClassificationChanged` domain event.

â†’ Fix: Remove the `classification` property from `MemberUpdateProps` to enforce the use of the explicit `changeClassification` method. This makes the contract unambiguous and ensures the correct domain event is always emitted for this state change.

```typescript
// src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts

export interface MemberUpdateProps {
  fullName?: string;
  email?: string | null;
  phone?: string | null;
  cpf?: string | null;
  // classification?: MemberClassification; // <-- REMOVE THIS LINE

  birthDate?: Date;
  // ... other properties
}
```

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM File:`/Users/brunozamorano/iptijuquinhas/ipt-web/src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts`:Line 16 â€“ Primitive obsession for controlled vocabularies
Fields like `sex` (line 41), `maritalStatus` (line 43), and `reception.mode` (line 16) are typed as `string`. This allows any string value, risking data inconsistency and deviating from the controlled vocabulary specified in the PRD. This also scatters validation logic instead of centralizing it within a type.

â†’ Fix: Define and use union types or enums for these fields to enforce a controlled vocabulary at the type level. This improves type safety and serves as self-documentation.

```typescript
// src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts

// Define controlled vocabularies
export type MemberSex = 'male' | 'female';
export type MemberMaritalStatus = 'single' | 'married' | 'divorced' | 'widowed';
export type MemberReceptionMode = 'profession_of_faith' | 'transfer' | 'restoration';

export interface MemberReception {
  date: Date;
  location: string;
  mode: MemberReceptionMode; // Use the new type
}

export interface MemberSnapshot {
  // ...
  sex: MemberSex; // Use the new type
  maritalStatus: MemberMaritalStatus; // Use the new type
  // ...
}

// Apply to other interfaces (MemberCreateProps, etc.) and the class properties as well.
// e.g., private _sex: MemberSex;
```

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM File:`/Users/brunozamorano/iptijuquinhas/ipt-web/src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts`:Line 32 â€“ Primitives used where Value Objects would be better
The investigation noted that Value Objects (VOs) for `Email`, `Cpf`, and `Birthdate` exist but are not used in the `Member` entity. The entity uses primitive types (`string`, `Date`), which means validation logic for these concepts is either missing or must be handled inside the entity, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

â†’ Fix: Refactor the `Member` entity to use the existing VOs. This encapsulates validation and formatting logic within the VOs themselves, making the `Member` aggregate cleaner and more robust. If this is too large a change for now, add a `// TODO:` comment explaining the planned refactoring.

```typescript
// Example assuming EmailVO and CpfVO exist
import { EmailVO } from '@/domain/vos/email.vo';
import { CpfVO } from '@/domain/vos/cpf.vo';

export interface MemberSnapshot {
  // ...
  email?: EmailVO | null;
  cpf?: CpfVO | null;
  // ...
}

export class Member {
  // ...
  private _email?: EmailVO | null;
  private _cpf?: CpfVO | null;
  // ...

  public static create(props: MemberCreateProps): Member {
    // ...
    const member = new Member({
      // ...
      email: props.email ? EmailVO.create(props.email) : null,
      cpf: props.cpf ? CpfVO.create(props.cpf) : null,
      // ...
    });
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

ðŸŸ¢ LOW File:`/Users/brunozamorano/iptijuquinhas/ipt-web/src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts`:Line 165 â€“ Shallow validation for required fields
The check for required fields for a `communicant` member (lines 151-167) is shallow. It verifies that `props.address` and `props.reception` are not `null` or `undefined`, but it doesn't validate their nested properties (e.g., `address.city`, `reception.date`). This could allow the creation of an invalid communicant member with incomplete address or reception data.

â†’ Fix: Add deeper validation for nested objects or, preferably, encapsulate `MemberAddress` and `MemberReception` into their own Value Objects that enforce their internal invariants upon creation.

```typescript
// src/domain/entities/member/member.entity.ts

// Example of deeper validation within the create method
if (classification === 'communicant') {
  // ... (existing checks)
  if (!props.address || !props.address.city || !props.address.street) {
    throw new DomainException(MemberErrorCodes.MISSING_COMMUNICANT_REQUIRED_FIELDS);
  }
  if (!props.reception || !props.reception.date || !props.reception.mode) {
    throw new DomainException(MemberErrorCodes.MISSING_COMMUNICANT_REQUIRED_FIELDS);
  }
}
```

### Overall code quality summary

The `Member` aggregate implementation is strong and well-aligned with DDD principles. It correctly models state transitions, enforces invariants, and emits domain events. The separation of concerns between the factory methods (`create`, `rehydrate`), state-mutating methods, and event handling is clear and effective. The main areas for improvement relate to strengthening type safety and standardizing error handling, which will significantly enhance long-term maintainability and robustness.

### Top 3 priority fixes

1.  Standardize Error Handling
2.  Clarify the Update API
3.  Introduce Controlled Vocabularies

### Positive aspects
- Clear Aggregate Root API; Idempotent state transitions; Effective Domain Events; Strong Encapsulation."

### O3 Logical Review
Complete feedback from Zen MCP:

"[MEDIUM] member.entity.ts:166 `throw new Error(MemberErrorCodes.MISSING_COMMUNICANT_REQUIRED_FIELDS);` â€“  Heterogeneous error-handling
â†’ Fix: Replace generic Error with the project-wide DomainException (or a specific InvalidOperationException) so that all domain errors can be handled uniformly.

```ts
import DomainException from "@/domain/errors/domain.exception";
// â€¦
if (missing.length > 0) {
  throw new DomainException(MemberErrorCodes.MISSING_COMMUNICANT_REQUIRED_FIELDS);
}
```

[MEDIUM] member.entity.ts:80 `classification?: MemberClassification` â€“  API confusion: update() completely ignores the optional classification field
â†’ Fix: Remove the field from MemberUpdateProps (or have update() delegate to changeClassification()) to avoid silent no-ops.

```ts
export interface MemberUpdateProps {
  fullName?: string;
  // â€¦ keep everything else
  // classification?: MemberClassification   <-- delete
}
```

[MEDIUM] member.entity.ts:229 `props.birthDate.getTime()` â€“  No validation that the supplied Date is valid; `new Date('')` passes through and NaN â‰  NaN, so every call is treated as a change and an invalid value is persisted
â†’ Fix: Before using a Date, verify `!isNaN(date.getTime())`, or better, adopt the existing Birthdate VO.

```ts
private static assertValidDate(d: Date, code: string): Date {
  if (!d || isNaN(d.getTime())) throw new DomainException(code);
  return d;
}
// use in create() and update()
```

[MEDIUM] member.entity.ts:14â€“17 / 41 / 43 `mode: string`, `sex: string`, `maritalStatus: string` â€“  Unconstrained free-text breaks invariants defined in PRD controlled vocabularies
â†’ Fix: Introduce literal-union types or enums (e.g., `type Sex = 'male' | 'female' | 'other'`). Validate on assignment just like classification.

[MEDIUM] member.entity.ts:152â€“166  â€“  Required-field check is only first-level; nested objects with empty strings (`address.city = ''`) still pass, violating R1.1
â†’ Fix: For communicant admissions either: (a) validate each nested mandatory sub-field (`address.city`, `reception.date`, `reception.mode`, â€¦), or (b) encapsulate Address/Reception into value objects that guarantee completeness.

[MEDIUM]  tests â€“  No unit tests for invariants and event emission paths
â†’ Fix: Add domain-level test cases: successful create, rejection on missing fields, idempotent archive/restore, update diff logic, invalid Date rejection, and classification change event.

[LOW] member.entity.ts:235 `if (props.address !== undefined) { this._address = props.address; changed = true; }` â€“  A shallow reference change always fires MemberUpdated even if the object is semantically identical, causing noisy event streams
â†’ Fix: Optionally perform a shallow/deep equality check before marking as changed, if event volume becomes an issue.

[LOW] member.entity.ts:199â€“205 â€“  `sanitizeFullName()` only trims; names with multiple internal spaces ("John  Doe") pass isValidFullName check
â†’ Fix: Collapse internal whitespace or use a regexp to enforce at least two distinct tokens when business rules require.

[LOW] member.entity.ts:120 `_events` â€“  Not thread-safe; acceptable in single-threaded Node; document assumption or guard later if concurrency is introduced.

â€¢ Overall code quality summary: strong, idempotent transitions and events. Top fixes: typed exceptions, Date validation, clarify update API."

### Rules-Specific Review
Complete feedback from Zen MCP:

"Excellent, the provided code and context give a clear picture of the `Member` aggregate's implementation. Here is a detailed review focusing on logic, edge cases, and domain invariants.

ðŸŸ  HIGH (Rules focus) member.entity.ts:229 â€“ Unvalidated Date objects can be persisted; add validation in create/update or adopt Birthdate VO.
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM â€“ `MemberUpdateProps` includes `classification` but `update()` ignores it; remove to enforce `changeClassification()`.
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM â€“ Required-field validation shallow for nested `address`/`reception`.
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM â€“ Inconsistent error handling (generic Error vs DomainException/InvalidOperationException) vs code-standards.
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM â€“ Controlled vocabularies as strings; introduce unions/enums.
ðŸŸ¢ LOW â€“ Extra blank lines inside `update()` vs standards.

Top 3 fixes: (1) validate Date or use VO, (2) remove classification from update props, (3) standardize exceptions. Positive aspects: clear aggregate API, idempotency, clean domain events pattern."
